// Hello.
(You son of a bitch.)
// I've not seen you for awhile.
(Thank God.)
*/ How are things?
(That was rhetorical.)
// I'm fine, personally.
(Hope you're not.)
/* I would love to get together sometime! */
(Maybe for a little bit of stabby surprise.)
/* Maybe next weekend? It's been too long.
(Waaaay too long. I'd almost forgotten how much I hate you.)
Great! See you then! */
(Jackass.)
// Bye!
